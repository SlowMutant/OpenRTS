"Open RTS" is the working title of an Open Source Real Time Strategy game. There is no good, playable, competitive, well balanced RTS, that is Open Source and Cross-Platform. With Warsow we have something like it in the FPS world. Simply said, this game shall be for RTS what Warsow is for FPS.  

The goals are not set in stone yet. Here is what we have so far.
    FOSS license
    platform independent
    low hardware requirements
    on par with Starcraft, ofc ;)
        usable in competitive gaming
        well-balanced
        match-making
        ladders
    unique (see the movement in Warsow)

There was a projekt called OpenRTS that died in 2006 or so. There is no relation whatsoever.
